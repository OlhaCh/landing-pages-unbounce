											I went to ICFR Indianapolis location. I am going on 11 sober now from alcohol addiction. The staff was wonderful, knowledgeable, and caring. The food was catered in daily and pretty good. The facility
											itself was nice. The rooms were very nice, we also had our own TVs in the rooms to watch after class. It was very calm and Paul for the most part. The occasional new client that tried to cause a stink got
											handled immediately. They didnâ€™t tolerate disruption at all. I really appreciated that. One of the best things for me, was the genesite test they offered. I found out that for 17 years I was on the wrong
											mental health medication. I am now on medication that aligns with my DNA and I havenâ€™t felt this good mentally since I was a teenager.
